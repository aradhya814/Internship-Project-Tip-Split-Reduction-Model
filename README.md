Project that was done in the Summer Internship at STL Python Based Data Analysis and Machine Learning 

## Project Title
Reducing Tip Split Defects in Optical Fibre Preform Manufacturing through Data Analytics

## Project Description
This project focuses on reducing tip split defects during the deposition process in optical fiber preform manufacturing. The primary objective is to utilize data analytics to identify the root causes of tip splits, develop predictive models to anticipate tip split occurrences, and optimize the manufacturing process to minimize these defects. The project is based on analyzing data from various stages of the optical fiber manufacturing process, including sintering, rod draw, cladding, quality control, and packaging.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering data from different stages of the manufacturing process and cleaning it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing data to identify patterns and correlations that could be contributing to tip split defects.
Predictive Modeling: Developing and testing various machine learning models to predict the occurrence of tip splits.
Optimization: Applying optimization techniques to minimize the risk of defects.
Results and Conclusion: Summarizing findings, model performance, and suggested improvements for the manufacturing process.
